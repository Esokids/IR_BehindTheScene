With soaring limestone islands, white sandy bays and colorful shacks, Thailand is one of the world's quintessential paradise destinations. It's the stuff of vacation fantasy. But while few places are better for a sun-drenched break, there's so much more to this country than kicking back with a cocktail. Head north to Chiang Mai for the very best in fresh Thai cooking and long bike rides through the surrounding hills and paddy fields. Trek the forests and mountains near Chiang Rai. And explore Ayutthaya's ancient temples. Bangkok, meanwhile, is the ultimate Asian metropolis, a lightning-paced city chock-full of stunning roof top bars and delicious street-food spots.
